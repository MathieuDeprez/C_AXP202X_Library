# C_AXP202X_Library
**C port of [AXP202X_Libraries](https://github.com/lewisxhe/AXP202X_Library) by lewisxhe**

lewisxhe's AXP202X library is ESP-IDF compatible ( but i didn't noticed) So i publish this, but **highly recommend you to use his original work.**

This is a pure C port of the C++ code, which can be used as a component for ESP-IDF. Nothing has been added, and very much was removed.

## Don't use that unless you know what you're doing.

The original purpose of this port was to be part of a lilygo's **[TWatch 2020 v1](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50036&Id=1290&FId=t3:50036:3)** framework adaptation for the ESP-EDF. Most of the details of the project are on [tixlegeek.io](https://www.tixlegeek.io) (fr)
